Automation tools can help transform unwieldly IT tasks—managing zero downtime rolling updates, for example—into something far more manageable. In this course, explore Ansible, an easy-to-use IT automation engine. To begin, instructor Jesse Keating explains what the Ansible system is, and how to install Ansible on a Linux operating system so you can start experimenting with it. Next, Jesse goes into the different components in an Ansible system, covering concepts such as how to work with hosts and variables and control task and play behavior. After he goes over the fundamental concepts of this system, Jesse shares some of the high-level use cases that Ansible was designed to tackle.
